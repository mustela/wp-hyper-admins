Simplify administration tasks for super-admins.

== Description ==

With this plugin, super-admins can:

* view any theme on any site, without enabling it
* access any site through Admin Bar -> My Sites, without having a role on it

Intended for [small Multisite installs](http://scribu.net/wordpress/the-future-of-multisite.html).
